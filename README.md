Project Description
The Annoying Alarm Clock is a minimalist, browser-based alarm application designed with one goal: to make waking up an unforgettable, infuriating experience. It forces the user to actively engage with it by making noise, ensuring they are truly awake before the alarm can be silenced.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world of gentle, soothing alarm tones and forgiving snooze buttons, people have become too comfortable with waking up peacefully. This has led to a catastrophic decline in morning-induced rage and a dangerous surplus of well-rested, pleasant individuals. We're here to fix that.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We have engineered a solution that replaces tranquility with mandatory chaos. Our alarm doesn't just ring; it demands tribute. To silence it, the user must produce 10 continuous seconds of sound, proving their wakefulness through sheer volume. No more silent fumbling to turn off your alarmâ€”you have to earn your peace and quiet.
